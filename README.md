# Student Management System

The Student Management System is a web application developed using PHP, HTML, XAMPP, and MySQL. It is designed to help educational institutions manage student records, grades, and other related information.

## Features

- **Student Information Management:** Record and manage student details, including name, address, contact information, and more.

- **Course and Grade Management:** Assign and manage courses, as well as record and calculate student grades.

- **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and access control for administrators, teachers, and students.

- **Database Backend:** The system uses MySQL as the database to store and manage student information.

## Requirements

- [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html): XAMPP is used to set up a local development environment with Apache, MySQL, PHP, and more.

- Web Browser: Any modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) for accessing the application.

## Installation
